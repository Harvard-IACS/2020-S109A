    "\n",
    "### On Python installation packages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main installing packages for Python, `conda` and `pip`. Pip is the Python Packaging Authority’s recommended tool for installing packages from the **Python Package Index (PyPI)**. `Conda` is a cross platform package and environment manager that installs and manages conda packages from the **Anaconda repository** and **Anaconda Cloud**. Conda does not assume any specific configuration in your computer and will install the Python interpreter along with the other Python packages, whereas `pip` assumes that you have installed the Python interpreter in your computer. Given the fact that most operating systems do include Python this is not a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I could summarize their differences into a sentence it would be that conda has the ability to create **isolated environments** that can contain different versions of Python and/or the packages installed in them. This can be extremely useful when working with data science tools as different tools may contain conflicting requirements which could prevent them all being installed into a single environment. You can have environments with pip but would have to install a tool such as virtualenv or venv. You may use either, we recommend `conda` because in our experience it leads to fewer incompatibilities between packages and thus fewer broken environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion: Use Both.** Most often in our data science environments we want to combining pip with conda when one or more packages are only available to install via pip. Although thousands of packages are available in the Anaconda repository, including the most popular data science, machine learning, and AI frameworks but a lot more are available on PyPI. Even if you have your environment installed via `conda` you can use `pip` to install individual packages \n",

    "`conda –V` \n",
    "\n",
    "If you get the version number (e.g. `conda 4.6.14`) you are all set! If you get an error, that means you do not have Anaconda and would be a good idea to install it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### - If you do not have it, you can install it by following the instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mac** : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows** : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows (Note:  #8 is important: DO NOT add to your path. The reason is that Windows contains paths that may include spaces and that clashes with the way `conda` understands paths.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - If you do have anaconda consider upgrading it so you get the latest version of the packages: \n",
    "\n",
    "`conda update conda`\n",

    "Conda allows you to work in 'computing sandboxes' called environments. You may have environments installed on your computer to access different versions of Python and different libraries to avoid conflict between libraries which can cause errors.\n",
